# Quantum-Computer-Feature-Selection

The repository in question focuses on the development of a project that implements an adaptation of the paper **"Quantum Computer Based Feature Selection in Machine Learning."** The original study investigates feature selection in supervised learning, comparing classical methods and quantum approaches, where the feature selection task is treated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. The solution is explored using classical optimization methods and quantum computing, such as the QAOA algorithm.
